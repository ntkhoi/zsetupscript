# zsetupscript
Setup useful development tools for your OSX.

## Why?
Everytime I fresh install OSX, I have to waste a lot of time on installing stuff (I'm a mobile and web developer). As you might guess, I'm lazy, that's why I created this script to help installing stuff easier.

## How?

1. Save the [file in this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zelic91/zsetupscript/master/setup_core.sh) as setup_script.sh (or whatever you want it to be)
2. Make usre the file is executable by running `chmod +x setup_core.sh`.
3. `./setup_core.sh`.
4. Feel fresh.
